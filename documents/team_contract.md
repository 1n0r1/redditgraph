### <strong>Communication</strong>
<strong>Team Meetings:</strong> Our team will have meetings every Sunday from 6-8PM at the collaborative work area of the Illinois Street Residence Halls. Every week, a designated notetaker will record our discussion topics and project progress with a shared Google Drive document. Team members will take turns as designated notetaker. If a team member has a time conflict, they should communicate it a week in advance so the meeting can be rescheduled or moved to zoom online. The first official team meeting will be on October 31st, 2021. <br>

<strong>Assistance:</strong> We will communicate via Discord. <br>

<strong>Respect:</strong> We want all of our team members to express their ideas freely. If a team member has issues with a certain aspect of the project, we agree that they should express themselves freely at either the in-person meetings or on Discord. <br>

### <strong>Collaboration</strong>


<strong>Work Distribution:</strong> During each of our weekly meetings, we will assign individual tasks and set broader goals. We will evaluate progress during each of these meetings, ensuring that we maintain an equal workload and that we meet deadlines. With programming, we do expect a lot of debugging for this project, so we will try our best to collaborate on these issues. Some ways we could address complications in our program would be consulting online guides such as StackOverFlow or Youtube. If we still face complications over a specific bug, we can always attend office hours for help. <br>

<strong>Time Commitment:</strong> In addition to our two hour weekly meetings on Sundays, we do expect members to contribute to the project outside of meeting times. On a regular week, we expect members to dedicate two to four hours to the project. However, as the deadline approaches, we expect members to dedicate up to six to seven hours weekly if necessary. If a member is not able to finish their task, we will split the unfinished work with the other members to ensure we meet our deadlines. However, if a team member habitually skips their assignments, we will consult with course staff to find a solution. <br>

<strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> Although unanimous agreement is preferred, decisions will be made by simple majority to ensure progress. If continued disagreements arise, the final decision will be made with a random number generator. We will have to agree that all members respect and follow the result no matter the outcome. <br>
